  desc: "Before the Mosaic hop even had a name (back when it was just known as “HBC 369”), our brewers couldn’t wait to get their hands on some. Mosaic Session IPA is bursting with vibrant grapefruit aroma and flavors of citrus and tropical fruit. Our signature dry-hopping technique delivers an incredibly drinkable lower ABV beer without sacrificing hop appeal. From a small test batch to the bottle you now hold in your hands, this isn’t a one-and-done beer. Sit back, have a few, and enjoy your session.",
